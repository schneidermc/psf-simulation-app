# PSF Simulation App

Matlab app for simulation and visualization of point spread functions (PSFs) for single molecule microscopy.

Tested for Matlab version 2021b and higher. Tested on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.
  
Please cite the corresponding publication if you are using our tool:

## Installation
### With Matlab installation
1. In Matlab, go to the tab *Apps* and click on *Install App*.
2. Select the file *PSF_simulation.mlappinstall* (available in the folder *installers*).
3. Click on *Install*.
4. Go to the tab *Apps* and click on the app *PSF simulation* (under *My apps*).

### Without Matlab license
If you do not have a Matlab license, you can use the app as a standalone application.
Run the installation by executing the file *psf-simulation-standalone-installer.exe* (available in the fodler *installers*).
It will download and install Matlab runtime (see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) for further information) and all files required for running the app.
