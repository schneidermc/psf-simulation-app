## Installation
### With Matlab installation
1. In Matlab, go to the tab *Apps* and click on *Install App*.
2. Select the file *PSF_simulation.mlappinstall*.
3. Click on *Install*.
4. Go to the tab *Apps* and click on the app *PSF simulation* (under *My apps*).

### Without Matlab license
If you do not have a Matlab license, you can use the app as a standalone application.
Run the installation by executing the file *psf-simulation-standalone-installer.exe*.
It will download and install Matlab runtime (see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) for further information) and all files required for running the app.
